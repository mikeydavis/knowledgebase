Token Based Authentication is not very different from other authentication mechanisms but yes, it is more secure, more reliable, and makes your system loosely coupled. It will be a better choice to create REST APIs using token-based authentication if your API has reached a broad range of devices, like mobiles, tablets, and traditional desktops.

In token based authentication, you pass your credentials [user name and password], which go to the authentication server. The server verifies your credentials and if it is a valid user, then it will return a signed token to the client system, which has an expiration time. The client can store this token for locally using any mechanism like local storage, session storage etc. and if the client makes any other call to the server for data, then it does not need to pass its credentials every time. The client can directly pass the token to the server, which will be validated by the server and if the token is valid, then you will able to access your data.
